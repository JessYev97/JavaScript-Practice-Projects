# JavaScript-Practice-Projects
In this repository I am working through a series of projects to learn the language and improve at coding. 

The lessons I am following along with in this repo are from SuperSimpleDev on YouTube. I am following along with the 22 hour 15 minute JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024). 
These projects are supplementing my studies in "The Odin Project" I found The Odin Project taught me HTML and CSS very well but that when it comes to JavaScript I was wanting more opportunities to practice implementing code beforee diving into their JS projects. This course I am completing on YouTube is really helping me to solidify the things I read about in TOP and has taught me new things the other program has not yet touched on.
